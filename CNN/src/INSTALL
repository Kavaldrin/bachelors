Windows:

Open cnn.sln
update your library paths
compile only x64

Required .dll:
opencv_world412.dll (opencv)
torch.dll (libtorch)
c10.dll (libtorch)

Linux:
Required:
python 3.7
boost
opencv
libtorch

remember to change HINTS in CMakeLists.txt

you have to also remember about retarded include paths in libtorch, it's is required to create symbolic links to api
you cannot copy them because it will raise error => "redefinition"
also important thing is that you have to use python3, in other way there will be linking problems
paths to dynamic libs have to be set(!)
